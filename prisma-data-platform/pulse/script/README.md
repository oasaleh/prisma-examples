# Prisma Pulse starter project

This repository has been created to help you get started with [Pulse](https://prisma.io/pulse). You will be able to use this project with any Pulse-ready PostgreSQL database. This project comes with a basic [`schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) file as well as a Pulse subscription found in the [`index.ts`](./index.ts) file.

## Prerequisites

To successfully run the project, you will need the following:

- The **connection string** of a Pulse-compatible database (if you don't have one yet, you can configure your database following the instructions in our [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/pulse/database-setup) or [use a Railway template](https://railway.app/template/pulse-pg?referralCode=VQ09uv))
- A **Pulse API key** which you can get by enabling Pulse in a project in your [Prisma Data Platform](https://pris.ly/pdp) account
  
## Getting started

### 1. Clone the respository

Clone the repository, navigate into it and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prisma/pulse-starter.git
cd pulse-starter
npm install
```

### 2. Create and fill out a `.env` file

Rename the existing `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

Now go into the `.env` file and update the `DATABASE_URL` and `PULSE_API_KEY` environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:password@host:PORT/database_name" 
PULSE_API_KEY="your_secure_pulse_api_key"
```

- `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string to your database.
- `PULSE_API_KEY`: Reference the [Environment API Keys](https://www.prisma.io/docs/platform/concepts/environments#api-keys) section in our documentation to learn how get an API key for your Pulse project.

### 3. Run the database migration

The `prisma/schema.prisma` contains three models based on our [hello-prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases/using-prisma-migrate-typescript-postgresql) example project:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### 4. Start the Pulse subscription

Run the [script](./index.ts) that contains the code to subscribe to database events:

```bash
npx ts-node index.ts
```

This will run a basic subscription on the `User` table. The code can be found in the [`index.ts`](./index.ts) file. To learn more about the Pulse API and how to use it, check out our [documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/data-platform/pulse/api-reference#subscribe).

<details><summary>Pulse user table subscription</summary>

```ts
async function main() {
  const subscription = await prisma.user.subscribe();

  if (subscription instanceof Error) {
    throw subscription;
  }

  for await (const event of subscription) {
    console.log("just received an event:", event);
  }
}
```

</details>

### 5. Test the subscription

The following instructions uses [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio) to create a new record in the `User` table. However, you can use any other method to write to the `User` table (e.g. a SQL client like `psql` or [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)) in order to trigger a database change event in Pulse.

1. Start Prisma Studio in a new terminal: `npx prisma studio`
2. Add a new record to the `User` table from Prisma Studio.
3. Return to your terminal where you ran the `npx ts-node index.ts` command.
4. If everything is set up properly you will see an output that is similar to the following.

    ```json
    {
      "action": "create",
      "created": {
        "id": 1,
        "email": "test@prisma.io",
        "name": "test"
      }
    }
    ```

## Deployment

You can also deploy this project on Railway by following the instructions in our [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/pulse/database-setup/railway#setup-with-template-prisma-pulse-db--app).
